# Lunacal Assesment

This project is a replica of a Figma design provided by Lunacal. The implementation is done using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and  UI library to match the design specifications as closely as possible.

## Introduction

This project is a front-end web application developed to replicate a Figma design provided by Lunacal. The goal was to create a visually accurate and responsive version of the design using modern front-end technologies like React.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

### 1. Tabbed Content Display

- The application includes a tabbed content display with three main tabs: `About Me`, `Experiences`, and `Recommended`.
- Users can switch between tabs, and each tab displays relevant content.
- The active tab is highlighted, and the tabs do not wrap, maintaining a consistent layout.

### 2. Image Gallery Carousel

- A carousel-style image gallery is implemented with the ability to add images dynamically.
- Users can click left or right arrows to navigate through the images.
- Default images are displayed initially, and users can add their own images by clicking the "Add Image" button.
- A hover effect is applied to the "Add Image" button, providing a subtle visual cue to the user.


## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, handling state, and managing the component structure.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application with responsive design utilities.
