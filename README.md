# Lunacal Figma File Replication

This project is a replica of a Figma design provided by Lunacal. The implementation is done using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and a preferred UI library to match the design specifications as closely as possible.

## Introduction

This project is a front-end web application developed to replicate a Figma design provided by Lunacal. The goal was to create a visually accurate and responsive version of the design using modern front-end technologies like React.js and Tailwind CSS.

The application consists of multiple components such as tabs, image galleries, and various UI elements that mimic the layout and styling of the original Figma design.

## Features

### 1. Tabbed Content Display

- The application includes a tabbed content display with three main tabs: `About Me`, `Experiences`, and `Recommended`.
- Users can switch between tabs, and each tab displays relevant content.
- The active tab is highlighted, and the tabs do not wrap, maintaining a consistent layout.

### 2. Image Gallery Carousel

- A carousel-style image gallery is implemented with the ability to add images dynamically.
- Users can click left or right arrows to navigate through the images.
- Default images are displayed initially, and users can add their own images by clicking the "Add Image" button.
- A hover effect is applied to the "Add Image" button, providing a subtle visual cue to the user.

### 3. Responsive Design

- The layout is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on laptop screens (above 768px) and other devices.
- Care has been taken to maintain consistent spacing, alignment, and sizing across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, handling state, and managing the component structure.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application with responsive design utilities.
